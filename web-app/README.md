## Installation

```
$ npm i 

$ npm run start
```

## Comments

* I found it tricky to understand what I was suppose to make from the document; so I hope it meets the criteria. 
* I think it would be great to devs to get a bit more context on Skylark and on what they are trying to achieve in this test.
* It seemed strange to me working with the API making so many requests for content on the client.
* I couldnt seem to see any image urls within the content data.

## Things to Improve

* Added unit-tests with Enzyme
* General spring clean
